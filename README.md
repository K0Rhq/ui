# KorUI

KorUI is a smart, modern, not-boring new design system and UI kit, built for Svelte 5.

### Design language

This design language builds on the traditional semantic and flat color token design systems, by adding glass and skeuomorphism effects on components and materials via shadows and color blend modes.

> [!NOTE]
> For older systems, rendering the shadows might be resource intensive, or maybe the user prefers a flatter interface. So there is a Tailwind variant `flat` that you would apply just like dark mode to change the style.

### Components

This component package is build with [`shadcn/svelte`](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com), which itself is mainly built on [Bits UI](https://bits-ui.com) and other various component primitives. Then the components are packaged up again and distributed via npm.
