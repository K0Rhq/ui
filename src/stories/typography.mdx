# Typography

We support two font styles:

* `Outfit` (sans)
* `Wittgenstein` (serif)

Use sans for general interfaces. Serif is meant for reading-heavy apps like Bibleio. **Don't mix serif and sans** in the same view.

**Use the toggle in the Storybook toolbar to preview both.**

In code, apply `font-sans` or `font-serif` to your layout or container element.

### Mono fonts

Both styles include the mono font `Chivo Mono` for code, labels, and display headings.

Apply `font-mono` to any element you want to style.
**Don’t use mono for body text or entire layouts.** It’s not a full font style. But it is also usually used with number based text.

Mono headers are usually fully capitalized using `uppercase`. Keep these short and descriptive — avoid full sentences.
